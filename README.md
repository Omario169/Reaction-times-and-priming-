# Reaction-times-and-priming-
This was an assigment for my Masters where I was given several datasets to analyse and visualse. The dataset looked at how participants reaction times varied depending on the primer stimulus that was presented. A host of statistical techniques were used in order to analyse the data and visualisation was performed using build in features in R. 


R was used to perform the exercise, however my original R script was lost as my old computer had broken down. Learning GitHub would have been benificial back then... However, the markdown file still existed on my University submission area and I thought it would be nice to keep it on my GitHub for memories sake.

If you are interested in looking at the graphs that are not available on the Markdown file, feel free to download the Word document attatched to the repository.
