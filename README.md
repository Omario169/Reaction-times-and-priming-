# Reaction-times-and-priming-
This was an assigment for my Masters where I was given several datasets to analyse and visualse. R was used to perform the exercise, however my original R script was lost as my old computer had broken down. Learning GitHub would have been benificial back then... However, the markdown file still existed on my University submission area and I thought it would be nice to keep it on my GitHub for memories sake.
